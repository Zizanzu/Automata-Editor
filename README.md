1.	Introduce
Automata Editor was my course project for the Theory of Computation course. It is a toolkit for working with deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata, as well as (classic) regular expressions.

2.	Features
•	Create an automaton. 
•	Save automata into files and load them.
•	Visualize the acknowledgment of a word in the editor.
